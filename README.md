This is the repository for my Shiny small app, 

it contains:

* server.R
* ui.R
* README.md
* additional files,  necessary for the documentation part of the app, 
    * but not listed yet.

Idea for the application came from...

rippling Quiz or Homework page and knit it into pdf file that eventualy is going to be sent to my Kindle to think about it in bed.
